  # face is that according to
  # https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.html#ch-nix-flakes
  # one must specify pkgs to pull from, which requires
  # setting a system. Thus homeConfigurations is not
  # portable across system architectures unless keyed
  # by a combination of user-system... hopefully this
  # will change in the future.
