# A web application

This is a simple web application with a backend api served from a single server.
All api calls will go in the `server` directory and all client implementation
goes in the `client` directory. This is effectively a BFF (backend for frontend)
architecture. It uses mostly my (@baetheus) own libraries written for TypeScript
run on [deno](https://deno.land).
